# Python Exercises

Below is a list of Python exercises that I have developed:

## 1.Score Tracker Game
A program to manage and track scores for a multiplayer game. It allows loading players, inputting scores for each round, viewing standings, removing players, and announcing the winner at the end of the game.

## 2.Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple Python program is a console-based game where the player tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 9 within a limited number of attempts.
### How to Play
1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` script.
2. You have three attempts to guess the secret number.
3. Click on the numbered buttons to make your guesses.
4. The game will provide feedback on each guess: "You guessed the number!" or "Keep trying..."
5. If you run out of attempts, the game will end, and you'll be informed of the outcome.
